# Bartender - GraphQL API (and soon a React front-end)

Something to muck around with to learn GQL, etc.  

The Bartender will be a 'spirit' tracking system coupled with a cocktail recipe management system.  Add what you have in your liquor cabinet, add recipes, get random recipes based on what you have in the bar.

## Requirements (will increase as functionality and robustness is fleshed out):
- node

## Usage:
`npm install`

```
npm start

ðŸš€  Server ready at http://localhost:4000/
```

Load http://localhost:4000/ in a browser and the resulting playground will allow you to interact with the graph
